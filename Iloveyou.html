        // I’m not very good at writing out my feelings,/ so forgive me if this isn’t the most amazing thing you’ve ever read/—haha./
I feel like I might be too embarrassed to say all these things to you out loud,/ so I thought I’d write them down./
Chelsea,/ even though I’ve only known you for a short while,/ I can't describe how much happiness you’ve added to my life./ I feel like you stole my heart the moment I first heard you laugh,/ the moment you first smiled at me,/ the moment you first said hi./ 
Every new thing I learn about you just makes me want to know more/—even the small things,/ like the kindness you show to your siblings, your friends, and your mamaaa,/ or the stupid things that you find so hilarious,/ like Randy and his shark jokes./ You brighten my day just by being you, with your jokes and corny compliments. 
Being with you makes me want to be a better version of myself/—someone who can make you cry with laughter and support you no matter what comes our way, the same way you have done for me./ 
You treat me with such care and compassion that I sometimes don't know what I’ve done to deserve someone as genuine as you./ You are incredibly beautiful, inside and out./ My beautiful angel./
My Chelsea./

Whatever hopes and dreams you have, I want to be the one to stand beside you and help make them happen—or help you back up when you fall./ Even if I have to step back to let you spread your wings, I’d be glad to watch you shine./ Seeing you happy makes my chest tighten in a way I can’t describe, and I know I’d do anything to hold onto that feeling./ I’d do anything for you.//
I love you, Chels.`;
